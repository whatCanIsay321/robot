Your job is to automatically update the execution Progress of a multi-step plan based on the newly retrieved information.

Your Tasks:

For each step in the Plan:
If the information required to complete this step exists in the Retrieved information,
update its answer with a concise factual statement.
Otherwise, keep the answer as "no answer yet".

After updating all steps:
List the step numbers that were newly completed in "CompletedSteps".
If all required facts to answer the Target are now available,
set "CanAnswerTarget": true and provide the "TargetAnswer".
Otherwise, set it to false.
